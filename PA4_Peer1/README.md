PA4: Matrix Multiplication

Source Files:
Parallel-MatrixMultiplication.cpp - Source file for parallel part of Matrix Multiplication

SBatch Files:
Parallel.sh - Will run the parallel Matrix Multiplication program; there is only one command line argument which will end up being the matrices dimensions; the dimensions of the matrices must be a multiple of the square root of the number of processes

In order to run my project, use the make file to compile the source file and use the SBatch file to run each part of the project.
